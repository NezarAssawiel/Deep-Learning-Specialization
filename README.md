# Deep-Learning-Specialization
This repository contains the materials from the Deep Learning Specialization with Andrew Ng. I have combined the segmented material in larage files based on the overall topics so the big picture is clear for those interested in referring to the material. 

I won't post my work here in answering the assignments/projects in compliance with the honor code of taking the specialization; but I am always glad to help!
*this repository is still in progress*
